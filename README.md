My undergraduate research with Dr. Greer at the University of North Alabama.  It explores the use of Latin Squares and Quasigroups to improve the security of existing encryptions without adding large amounts of overhead.

The basis for the research can be found in [All-Or-Nothing Transforms Using Quasigroups](http://delab.csd.auth.gr/bci1/Balkan/183Marnas.pdf).

The presentation slides for this research can be viewed [here](https://kkurzhal.github.io/undergrad_research/reveal.js/).
